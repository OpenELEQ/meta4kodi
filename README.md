# Meta for Kodi

Are you using addons for streaming of movies or TV series? Meta is here to make your life a bit easier!

### Description
Instead of searching for the same content through all of your addons,
you simply find it in Meta and a list of all links from all configured addons
will be displayed right in front of you, allowing the selection of the addon to
use for playback. Meta can also search your local library or custom directories. 

### How does it work?
Meta lists content from TMDB and TVDB. 
By default, none of the media is playable. However, other addons can be linked to Meta by writing small configuration files referred to as Meta-players (see [Wiki](https://github.com/metate/meta4kodi/wiki)). Meta uses the hints in the Meta-player to browse the external addon, find list items that match the desired media and create playable links from the paths of these items. Meta aggregates all discovered links and displays them to the user in a simple and well organized selection dialog.

### Other features
